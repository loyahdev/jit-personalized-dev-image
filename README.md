# JIT-Personalized-Dev-Image

### I aim to create the ability to run JIT (Just In Time) Compilation on iOS devices running iOS 17

With the release of iPadOS and iPhoneOS 17, the way to enable JIT on the devices has changed. The original way to enable it from iOS 11 - iOS 16 was to use a developer disk image and signature found in the Xcode files at the location Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/

The full instructions for iOS versions below iOS 17 excluding some versions such as 16.6 are at https://github.com/haikieu/xcode-developer-disk-image-all-platforms
